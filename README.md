# Customer-Churn-Prediction
"A machine learning project to predict customer churn using Python and ML models."

## Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning techniques. It aims to help businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographics, service usage, and subscription details.

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
5. Evaluation (Accuracy: 85%, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Results
- Identified top factors influencing churn.
- Model Accuracy: 85%

## Files
- `churn_prediction.py`: Python script for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `data/customer_churn.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.
- `visualizations/`: Folder with charts and graphs.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_link>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script: `python churn_prediction.py`
